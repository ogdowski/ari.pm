# Hello
### My name is Ariel

![This is how I usually look](./public/avatar.png)

I am [software developer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ogdowski/), with a passion for DevOps and cloud solutions.

I am also [homebrewer](https://untappd.com/Browarieli) and I really like [lifting weights](https://www.youtube.com/user/damogari/videos).

I consider myself [INTJ](https://personalityjunkie.com/the-intj/), like to learn new things, and constantly searching for intellectual challenges.

Trying to lead a [minimalist](https://nosidebar.com/minimalism/) lifestyle, drawing inspiration from the [stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism). I strive to consume less and create more.

I live in [Gdansk, Poland](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=11/54.3612/18.5714), but sometimes I like to go somewhere else for a few weeks. Traveling is amazing.

Lifelong fan of Star Wars and all science fiction stuff. Avid online FPS player.
